# Nirium

Open-source autonomous treasury and agentic payments (x402/MPP) for Stellar/Soroban.

This repository contains the TypeScript and Python SDKs, the MCP server, the CLI, examples and quickstarts that let any developer:

- **Get paid by AI agents**: put your own API behind an x402 pay-gate in one call with `x402Serve()`, or pay for someone else's with `initX402()`.
- **Automate on-chain treasury**: a Nirium agent moves idle capital into a CETES strategy (tokenized Mexican T-bills via Etherfuse) and back, over a vault **you** own. The agent can propose a rebalance without ever holding a signing key; autonomous execution on mainnet (the agent signs) is invite-only while a legal review closes.
- **Anchor immutable audit trails**: SHA-256 content hash pinned to IPFS, optionally carrying an ed25519 signature that proves *who* declared the fact, not just that it is unaltered.

Software-only and non-custodial: regulated partners execute settlement, the client signs every fund movement, and Nirium never holds client funds.

## Packages

| Package | Install | Version | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| TypeScript SDK | `npm install nirium` | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nirium)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nirium) | Client for the Nirium API, x402/MPP payments, signals, webhooks, plus `x402Serve()` to charge for your own API. |
| Python SDK | `pip install nirium` · `pip install 'nirium[langchain]'` | [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/nirium)](https://pypi.org/project/nirium/) | Async client with the same surface, plus `NiriumX402Tool` for LangChain agents. |
| MCP server | `npx nirium-mcp` | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nirium-mcp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nirium-mcp) | 25 tools for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible IDE. |
| CLI | `npm install -g nirium-cli` | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nirium-cli)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nirium-cli) | Scaffold and interact with Nirium from the terminal. |

> The source in `packages/` matches what is published. The two SDKs have identical **client** surfaces; TypeScript is one minor ahead because `x402Serve()` is Express middleware: server-side Node, with no meaningful Python equivalent. That gap is the honest signal, not a lag.

Signing with a social-login wallet instead of a raw keypair? See [`nirium-pollar-adapter`](https://github.com/nirium-protocol/nirium-pollar-adapter), a separate package that adapts [Pollar](https://pollar.xyz)'s embedded-wallet SDK to sign x402 payments and audit records through this SDK.

## Quickstart: pay for an API (TypeScript)

```bash
npm install nirium
```

```ts
import { Agent } from 'nirium';

const agent = new Agent({ baseUrl: 'https://nirium-agent.fly.dev' });
const market = await agent.getMarket();
console.log(market);
```

## Quickstart: charge for *your* API

The other side of the counter. Wiring x402 by hand is ~25 lines of facilitator client, per-method auth headers, per-network scheme registration and a route table whose shape you have to reverse-engineer. This is the same thing with the defaults that already run in production:

```ts
import { x402Serve } from 'nirium';

app.use('/premium', x402Serve({
    payTo: 'G...',              // your Stellar address
    routes: { 'GET /signals': '$0.02' },
}));
```

Any AI agent can now pay for your endpoint in USDC: no account, no card, no subscription, no human awake.

See [`docs/`](./docs) for full quickstarts, including [**"Charge AI agents in 5 minutes"**](./docs/quickstart-x402.md), and [`examples/`](./examples) for runnable Express, Next.js, [LangChain x402](./examples/langchain-x402-agent), and [non-custodial treasury vault](./examples/treasury-vault-quickstart) integrations. For real production findings (not marketing copy), see the [**devlog**](./docs/devlog.md).

## Networks

Live on **both** Stellar networks. They are not two copies of the same thing.

**Mainnet** (real value). The API box holds **no signing key** by design; a separate process with no HTTP surface signs autonomous rebalances, and clients sign their own fund movements.

| What | Verify |
|---|---|
| First real x402 payment | [`3134a51c…7558bc`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/3134a51c66091fd7fbd85b38a4a6ec6cd432bb92c2450eac84ea7855cb7558bc) |
| Treasury vault deployed (client signs) | [`93ff6284…78416`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/93ff6284cdf03706624c88434a79fba1b213ee547f58e09a9248f75373178416) |
| Autonomous invest (**the agent signs**) | [`82d73f53…6b3d4`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/82d73f537e907140367f9343f63a36704c74a5286aced7a938cee8fffb56b3d4) |
| API | [`nirium-agent-mainnet.fly.dev/health`](https://nirium-agent-mainnet.fly.dev/health) |

That third transaction is the point: the agent moved funds it does not own, and the contract gave it no way to take them out. Nirium holds only the vault's `RebalanceManager` role, and `rebalance()` accepts no destination address: withdrawal is not *forbidden*, it is **inexpressible**.

**Testnet** (no real value, where the loop and the key live, and where you should build).

| Contract | ID |
|---|---|
| NiriumVault | [`CBTWMZCG3P72EHFAQ4ZLSEBIOFYJC244H5J6DHZIJ56FHFWJ2CFAWSZU`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CBTWMZCG3P72EHFAQ4ZLSEBIOFYJC244H5J6DHZIJ56FHFWJ2CFAWSZU) |
| NiriumProtocol | [`CC2TU5BDTKTPRRRQPEF77I54XYHFQ25XGIRO2TCWKSR7NRJDFR5L5NR5`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CC2TU5BDTKTPRRRQPEF77I54XYHFQ25XGIRO2TCWKSR7NRJDFR5L5NR5) |

API: [`nirium-agent.fly.dev/health`](https://nirium-agent.fly.dev/health) · node catalog: [`/api/nodes`](https://nirium-agent.fly.dev/api/nodes)

Nirium's own **NiriumVault** treasury contract stays on testnet and is audit-gated: no independent third-party audit has happened yet, and no client funds ever reach it. The mainnet treasury path runs over a **DeFindex** vault instead: a third-party contract audited by OtterSec (March 2025, 16 findings, all 13 vulnerabilities resolved) on a Blend V2 strategy.

## External validation

Real bugs found in code we don't control, in other people's repos, confirmed by maintainers with no reason to agree if they weren't real.

**[x402-foundation/x402#3171](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/issues/3171)** — `paymentRequirementsMatchAccepted()` in `@x402/core` threw a raw internal `TypeError` instead of a protocol-level error when a payment's `accepted` field was missing or null. We filed it after hitting it live against our own production endpoint. Fixed by an external contributor, [JasonColapietro](https://github.com/JasonColapietro) — not us — in [PR #3180](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/pull/3180). Maintainer [phdargen](https://github.com/phdargen) approved and merged it: *"Thanks for the patch @JasonColapietro, LGTM 🚀"* — commit [`ab1a31a`](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/commit/ab1a31ab56ef8656908562d5c2b691772c5a85a2), 55/55 tests passing, issue closed automatically as completed.

**[OpenZeppelin/relayer-plugin-x402-facilitator#47](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/relayer-plugin-x402-facilitator/issues/47)** — a facilitator sponsor account we rely on went silent for 205+ hours; a different account appeared active on pubnet 3 days later with a matching activity pattern, but we can't confirm ownership from outside. Filed as an open question, not a claim: if it's theirs, it's a config fix on our side; if not, the outage is broader than us. A second, unrelated integrator ([AgentLedger](https://agentpayments.fi)) independently hit the same account failing on their own settlements — we verified their four transaction hashes and both account histories ourselves, directly against Horizon. Two independent parties now confirm the same diagnosis; the one question that matters — whether the new account is OpenZeppelin's official rotation — is still unanswered. **Open, awaiting OpenZeppelin's response — not resolved.**
