# Nirium — 10 minutes for a reviewer

Not a Claude Code session, not a deep dive. Five things, in order of how much
you have to trust us to believe them. Every link below is something you can
check yourself right now — none of it depends on taking our word for it.

## 1. Something live, in 30 seconds

```bash
curl https://nirium-agent.fly.dev/api/nodes
```

Real JSON, no auth, right now: the live status of every execution node
(Settlement, Audit Trail, Treasury Rebalance, Payouts, Reporting), which
network each runs on, and which endpoints back it. This is what the whole
project actually is — not a pitch deck, a running API you just hit.

## 2. Treasury Node — real money, on mainnet, with a contract that can't take it

Nirium doesn't hold the vault. It holds the `RebalanceManager` role of a
[DeFindex](https://defindex.io) vault the client owns, and DeFindex's own
`rebalance()` function never takes a destination address — withdrawal isn't
forbidden, it's inexpressible in the contract. That's not our framing; it's
verifiable in DeFindex's own source.

Three things you can check on Stellar Expert directly:

- Vault deployed, client signs: [`93ff6284…78416`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/93ff6284cdf03706624c88434a79fba1b213ee547f58e09a9248f75373178416)
- Autonomous invest, **the agent signs** — this is the one that matters: the agent moved funds it doesn't own, and the contract gave it no way to take them out. [`82d73f53…6b3d4`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/82d73f537e907140367f9343f63a36704c74a5286aced7a938cee8fffb56b3d4)
- The vault contract itself, roles readable on-chain: [`CAMDXG6L…K57MH`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/contract/CAMDXG6L4LXLXXV675KZSHM3BMSETZ4NVMC7JYIQCZ2JTG54OMSK57MH)

The underlying vault strategy (Etherfuse CETES on Blend v2) was audited by
OtterSec, March 2025 — 16 findings, all 13 vulnerabilities resolved. Full
writeup with the same links: [nirium-sdk's own
README](https://github.com/nirium-protocol/nirium-sdk#what-runs-where-and-how-to-check-it-yourself),
and the identical evidence is cross-referenced in
[nirium-pollar-adapter](https://github.com/nirium-protocol/nirium-pollar-adapter)
and the private repo's docs — three independent places citing the same
verifiable transactions, not three different claims.

## 3. A real partner integration, not a listed logo

[`nirium-pollar-adapter`](https://github.com/nirium-protocol/nirium-pollar-adapter)
lets a wallet onboarded through [Pollar](https://pollar.xyz) (social login,
zero seed phrase) pay for x402 APIs and sign audit records without touching
a raw Stellar key. Two concrete artifacts:

- **Merged, not just proposed**: [nirium-pollar-adapter PR #1](https://github.com/nirium-protocol/nirium-pollar-adapter/pull/1) (deferred-mode wallet funding) merged 29 Aug 2026.
- **Live demo**: [nirium-pollar-x402-demo.vercel.app](https://nirium-pollar-x402-demo.vercel.app) — log in with Google, pay a real x402 endpoint, holding zero XLM end to end.

Honest status on the piece still in flight: the demo-app integration itself,
[pollar-apps#30](https://github.com/pollar-xyz/pollar-apps/pull/30), is
**open and mergeable, not yet merged** as of this writing — Pollar's own
maintainer has signaled intent to merge but hasn't yet. Listed here as
open, not claimed as done.

## 4. Upstream contributions — bugs fixed in code we don't control

The strongest kind of evidence: a maintainer with no reason to agree if it
weren't real, agreeing.

| Where | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [stellar/stellar-dev-skill#96](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-dev-skill/pull/96) | Nirium listed in Stellar's own official developer-skills catalog | **Merged** 15 Aug 2026, reviewed by SDF DevRel |
| [stellar/stellar-dev-skill#97](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-dev-skill/pull/97) | Multiple real production-hardening fixes to the agentic-payments skill (x402/MPP) | Open, CI green, under review |
| [x402-foundation/x402#3171](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/issues/3171) | Filed by us against `@x402/core`'s reference implementation; fixed by an unrelated third-party contributor, not us | **Closed** 17 Aug 2026 — external confirmation, not self-reported |
| [OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts#844](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/pull/844) | Fix for a real `fee-abstraction` expiration-check bug we found and filed | Open, mergeable, awaiting maintainer review |

## 5. GrantFox — the real numbers, not the flattering summary

`nirium-sdk`'s GrantFox bounty program, all three campaigns to date
(Official Campaign, FWC26, Third Campaign — the last one wrapped 30 Aug
2026), audited issue by issue against real merged PRs, not counted by
title:

**42 total bounty asks. 20 delivered with a merged PR into `nirium-sdk`
itself. 2 more delivered as real, substantive PRs against external target
repos, still open there awaiting that project's own maintainer review — not
yet merged. 4 closed and cleanly recreated as new issues, not abandoned. 16
closed with no deliverable at all, reported honestly rather than omitted.**

Verify the raw numbers yourself:

```bash
gh issue list --repo nirium-protocol/nirium-sdk --label "GrantFox OSS" --state all --json number | jq length
```

Board is fully closed — `gh issue list --repo nirium-protocol/nirium-sdk
--label "GrantFox OSS" --state open` returns `[]`. Nothing stale left
open to re-litigate.
